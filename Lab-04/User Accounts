* Getting info aboput users and groups
	
	$ cd /etc/
	Here you will have three files of our interest i.e. passwd, shadow and group
	
	$ cat passwd
	It stores the user information in follwoing format
	[user]:x[for password]:[User Id]:[Group Id]:[User Name],[Address],[Phone],[Default Dir]:[Shell Script]
	
	$ sudo cat shadow
	It stores the passwords in encrypted form most probably by SHA256 key.
	
	$ cat group
	It stores the information about groups
	[Group Name]:x:[Group Id]
	
* Creating new users

	$ sudo adduser nameOfUserAccount
	Provide all the information and your user have been created.
	The user will be created inside the group having same name (nameOfUserAccount) as user by default.
	User can't exist without group.
	
	$ su - nameOfUserAccount
	switch to another user mode
	
	You can change the default dir of user by modifying the passwd file
	Open passwd file in sudo mode. Go to the line where you find the user account info
	There you only need to change the default dir which is next to Phone
	You are  done and close the file and enjoy!
	
	$ sudo addgroup
	
	$ sudo usermod -g groupName  nameOfUserAccount
	This will move 'nameOfUserAccount' account to group 'groupName'
	
	$ sudo delgroup group
	It deletes the given group
	
	$ sudo deluser user
	It deletes the given user
	
	$ sudo deluser -f user
	Force delete
	
* File Ownership

	Syntax 	chown [user]:[group] file
	
	$ sudo chown user file
	Now this user owns the file
	Give the permission through chmod
	
	$ sudo chmod u+x file
	
	$ sudo chown :group file
	Now file is also owned by a group
	
	$ sudo chmod g+x file
	
	File can be owned by just one group at a time.
